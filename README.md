# Sparta-Bootstrap-Homework

## Task
We made three pages using bootstrap to structure all three pages. Each page consists of a navbar, a jumbotron, two rows and a footer.

## Challenges
We found it challenging to make the images in each row the same height as the text in it's respective row. To solve this problem, we formatted the image as a background image using css instead of inserting in the html code. 

We discovered that for small screen resolutions, the images in the rows moved on top of and below the text. They also became too big and did not look good anymore. We solved this problem by adding a media query to remove the image for small screen resolutions.
